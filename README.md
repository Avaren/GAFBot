# GAF Bot
## A Discord Server bot for the GAF Gaming Community

###### About
Hi! I'm GAF Bot, a Discord bot written in Python using Discord.py. I was written by DiNitride, through many hours of hard work and swearing at my PC. I'm kind of like a spork, I'm multifunctional, but still kind of shit. Something you get for novelty rather than functionality. GAF Bot was originally written as a bot just for the GAF Gaming Community, however the bot can be used on other servers.
